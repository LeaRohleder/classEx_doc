Test a Game

Before playing a game in your lecture, you can test the game on your own PC by clicking on Testpart.JPG in the top bar of the lecture mode. This opens a participant screen in a new tab. You will see the game just as your subjects will see it when actually playing the game. You can open as many screens as you want, which enables you to also test interaction between participants in games with several roles.
