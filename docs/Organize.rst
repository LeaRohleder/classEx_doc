Organize games and course
==========================

You can organize your games in the overview mode. Here, you can find all your games as well as the ready-made games that are shown in your overview by default.

On the left hand side you find the folders for own games (empty at first login) and the folders for ready-made games (standard games, quiz & questionnaire,...).

In the top right-hand corner, you find the main navigation bar which is always displayed in every mode. This allows you to switch from one mode to another and access your personal data.

The currently active mode is marked by a darker shade around its symbol |pic_overview|, here the **overview mode**. The left symbol |pic_lecturemode| takes you to the **lecture mode**. The right symbol |pic_editmode| takes you to the **editing mode**. The **drop down menu** (which shows the name of the lecturer and is shaded in black in the figure above) provides access to your personal data and your course data as well as the terms of use, the documentation, some general info on classEx and the logout button.

Folders
=======

Games are sorted into folders, for example different chapters of lectures, which can be found on the left. You can create a new folder by clicking on *new folder* in the top bar. Folders can be renamed by typing in the box above the list of games in a folder. It is not possible to change the order of folders. 

Handle games
============

You can move games by clicking on the little icon on the *move game* icon and dragging the game to another folder or just change its poition in the current folder. You can directly enter the Lecture Mode to play a game by pressing the *play game* icon and directly enter the editing Mode to edit a game by clicking on the *edit game* icon. Games marked with the *created by someone else* icon cannot be edited but only played or viewed. The *delete game* icon deletes a game.

Public, private and imported games
==================================

All games are marked be either the *public game*,  *private game* or *created by someone else* icon. The *public game* icon means that you created the game but other users can see and copy this game. The *private game* icon means your game is private and cannot be seen by other users. You can change the game status between private or public by clicking on the symbol. The *created by someone else* markes the ready-made games and all games you imprted from the repository. You cannot edit them but only view and play them. If you want to make your own version of such a game you have to copy it.

Copy games
==========

If you want to make a copy of a game (e.g. to create your own version of a ready-made game) click on the *view* or *edit* button. This takes you the editing mode. In the top bar you can now click on the drop down menu *game* and then select *copy game*. This will create a coy of the game in your *general folder*. You can edit this copy and thus make your own version of any public game on classEx.

Repository
==========

The repository gives you an overview and access to the all public games created by you and other lecturers and allows you to import these games to your account. If you do not want your game to be listed in the repository you have to change its status from public to private. You can enter it by clicking on the *repository* button in the top bar of the overview.

Clicking on the *Game information* button shows some more information (if set by the owner) and a sample screenshot.
