Overview

Publicprivate2.PNG

Here, you can find an overview of all your games as well as the standard games that are in your overview by default. You can create a new game by clicking on new game in the top bar. Games are sorted into folders, for example different chapters of lectures, which can be found on the left. You can create a new folder by clicking on new folder in the top bar. Folders can be renamed by typing in the box above the list of games in a folder. You can move games from one folder to another by clicking on the little arrow on the right-hand side and choosing a new folder from the drop-down menu.

You can directly enter the Lecture Mode to play a game by pressing the button Playy.JPG and directly enter the Editing Mode to edit a game by pressing the button Editt.JPG. Games that were created by other users cannot be edited but only played or viewed. The little arrows Arroww.JPG allow you to change the sequence of games within a floder. Clicking on the symbol Rubbish.JPG deletes the game. This symbol Open.PNG means that you have set the game to be public, which means that other users can also see and copy this game. This symbol Closed.PNG means your game is private. You can change this setting by clicking on the symbol. Tag.PNG means that the game was created by another user and, thus, its settings cannot be edited by you.

The button repository in the top bar gives you access to the repository which contains all public games created by you and other lecturers.
