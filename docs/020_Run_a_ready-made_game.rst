Practical tips

The following hints should give you some advice to avoid problems when using classEx especially the first time.
Information upfront for students (e.g. via email)

• Students have to bring a device that has internet access to class, preferably a smart phone, but a tablet or laptop computer also work.

• The devise has to have enough battery left (suggest to bring a charger).

• The browser they use should be up-to-date.
Before the course

• Make sure that you are not logged into your account on another computer (e.g. in your office). You can not log into the system from two different computers at the same time.
Before you start

• Make sure you have a stable internet connection as a lecturer. The best option is with a cable.

• It is best not to use the same connection (e.g. wifi) as the participants in case the network slows down.

• The ideal browser to use is Mozilla firefox (in a current version). Javascript has to be turned on and cookies allowed (normally default setting).
Information for students in the course

• Students need to stay logged in until the experiment is over.

• Students need to close all the apps. Having other apps open might log students out.

• If the experiment has already started (and some decisions have already been entered), students might not be able to join the experiment any more.

• If students are chosen randomly to receive their payoff, they should screenshot their winner's notification to be sure to receive their payoff.
During the experiments

• If you accidentally close the browser, no problem. Just open it again. Normally you should be still logged in. Otherwise just log in again.

• In case you want to logout all participants, just press the logout all participants button in the "course data" section.

• Note that there is no way back if you continue to feedback or next round/session.

• If your game has several rounds / stages, make sure to stay in the first round long enough, as this is where students are matched.
After the experiment

• You can download the excel files containing the data of the game.

• If you want to go back to compare the current results with old ones or ones in different courses, click on “previous results”.
Password forgotton

• If you have forgotton your password, you can simply click on the little "get a new password" button underneath the login button. You only need to enter your email address with which you registered.
