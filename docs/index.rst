Welcome to the LIONESS Lab documentation!
==================================================

LIONESS Lab is a free web-based platform for online interactive experiments.
LIONESS experiments include standardized methods to deal with group formation,
handling participant dropout and other challenges of online interactive experiments.

With LIONESS Lab you can readily develop and test your LIONESS experiments online in an user-friendly environment.
You can develop experiments from scratch in a point-and-click fashion or start from an existent design from our growing
repository and adjust it according your own requirements. A what-you-see-is-what-you-get interface allows you to easily
define participant screens. You can use JavaScript for any programming - e.g. to calculate payoffs or manipulate
variables. You can use a range of ready-made functions to get data from (and write to) the server.

Once your LIONESS experiment is ready, you can download it and run it on your own server. Participants can then be
invited to online sessions, e.g. by using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). At the end of a session, you can download a
spreadsheet with the data, as well as a file to automate bonus payments on MTurk.
Using LIONESS Lab you can choose to share LIONESS experiments with your co-authors and other experimenters.
