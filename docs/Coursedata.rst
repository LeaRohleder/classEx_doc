Password forgotten

If you have forgotten your lecturer password and you cannot login, classEx provides a function to get a new password. At the login screen, select your course and select "experimenter/lecturer" and click on the small text "get a new password" button underneath the login button. You only need to enter your email address with which you are registered with. Then you will get a new password via email.


Course data

Change course data
-------------------

Course title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the course data you can change the title of your course which also appears at the login screen. Course titles can be the name of the lecturer or the title of the course. It should easily recognizable for participants in order to facilitate their login.

.. note:: Please make sure that you do not use the same title as another course at your institution. 

Course language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also switch the language of the course in the course data. ClassEx provides support for German, English and Spanish. The latter is only available for the participants' interfaces and the lecture mode. The overview and the editing mode will still be in English in this case.

.. note:: The course language may differ from the language of the game. If a adequate translation is available, classEx uses the translation. Otherwise it will look for an English version of the game. If this is not available, the game will be displayed in its original language.

.. note:: If you change the language, changes only apply if you logout and login again. The same holds true for participants and test participants. Participants are not affected by these changes while a session is running.
